  # Format is: [FDSNWS, url, token] and/or [StationXML, file.xml] 
  # When FDSNWS-station is used, you have to set null to the 3rd variable
  # since no restricted metadata exist and no token is needed. Also, the
  # most updated inventory will be retrieved from the FDSNWS hosts, 
  # relevant to the seismic events. The more services you provided,

  # where loc is the initial location (hypocenter) of the event

  # where loc is the initial location (hypocenter) of the event
  # and only for channel type of HN, EN (Strong-Motion stations)
  # If for some reason (e.g. seismic network orientation), 
  # you need to define a different set of Distance rules according
  # to regional restrictions, another configuration file is needed

  # Azimuth has the form of: [minSectors, maxStations per sector]
  # 8 sectors of 45 deg each are defined around the initial location
  # (hypocenter) of the event. The first number indicates the number 
  # of sectors, where at least one station is found, to be considered.
  # For example, a value of 1 indicates that proceed with the MT 
  # calculation even there is only 1 sector coverage (weak station 
  # azimuthal distribution) and easily reached. A value of 8 is the 
  # maximum value, where it requests at least x stations per sector 
  # for all sectors (strong azimuthal distribution) and might not be 
  # easily reached (based on networks' regional limitation)
  # We set a value of 3 at least sectors as a feasible case scenario.
  # x stations: The next value indicates the number of stations that 
  # is within the sector, in order to flag the sector as valid. 
  # A null valid can be used, in order to use all possible stations 
  # found. At the above example, Gisola will continue the MT 
  # computations only if at least 3 sectors, with a maximum of 2 
  # stations, are found, otherwise it will indicate an azimuthal error
  # and it will stop the process. If more stations are found, than the 
  # limitation, the Gisola will sort according to (i) priority value, 
  # ii) type: first Broadband, then Strong-Motion, iii) the number of 
  # passed traces (NEZ), iv) lowest distance from the epicenter 
  # and retrieve only those that reach the limit. In our case,
  # a minimum of 3*2=6 stations will be necessary, in order to continue 
  # with the MT procedure. While the maximum could be 8*2=16 stations.
  # This must also comply with the parameters defined in the 
  # parameters.f90 file within the inversion code.

  # For realtime operation is recommended a SeedLink service. However,

  # The modules help to choose good quality waveforms. 
  # The possible values are: clip, mouse, snr, ppsd, ppsdoffline
  # * clip: real-time check for clipped waveforms (based on module's threshold)
  # * mouse: real-time check for disturbances so-called mouses
  # * snr: real-time check for clipped waveforms (based on module's threshold)
  # * ppsd: real-time check by comparing Power Spectral Densities (based 
  # on module's threshold). This module requires 1-hour of data before
  # event. Thus, more time will be needed to finalize the MT computation
  # * ppsdoffline: The same mechanism reads a directory with PPSD values
  # per station. Thus, a cronjob needs to run (e.g. daily) to update them.
  # Currently, it can be used for realtime operation (keeps no history).
  # Use an empty list [] if no modules need to be set.
  # Recommended for real-time operation:
  # Modules: ['clip', 'ppsdoffline', 'mouse']
  # Recommended for past-time operation:
  # Modules: ['clip', 'ppsd', 'mouse']
  Modules: ['clip', 'ppsd', 'mouse']

# Greens' Functions (GFs) computation
# GFs are computed in real-time according to
# event's location, previous rules, and MT search grid dimensions.
Green:
  # The operator can set different grids based on the size
  # of event. Multiple grids could be triggered simultaneously.
  # The best-correlated solution will be chosen, however, more time
  # will be needed for finalizing the MT computation. You can
  # have an adjustable grid by adding as many as you like
  # inner distance and depth rules. Every rule has the
  # form of minValue, maxValue, and stepValue in km.
  # In the distance rules, the starting point is relevant to
  # the init estimated location of the hypocenter, and a square will
  # be generated where the location will be at the center of it.
  # The above mechanism will be performed for each possible depth 
  # (see below), leading to a cube of MT computations.
  # For each point of the cube, time-shifted searches will be 
  # calculated, leading finally to a 4D grid MT search and the 
  # best-correlated solution will be chosen.
  # In the depth rules the starting point is relevant to
  # the init estimated depth of the hypocenter. And the 
  # search continues in two directions; above and below it
  # (auto limits to 1 km from the surface).
  # For example, according to this configuration,
  # if Mag==6.0, Gisola will trigger only the second rule,
  # thus 1 grid will be generated. The grid points where 
  # the MT calculations will be performed, will start 
  # from 0 to 9 km with a step of 4 km starting from hypocenter location,
  # meaning: 0, 4, 8 km from h. loc. in four directions (east, west,
  # north, south), thus -8, -4, 0, 4, 8 (horizontally and vertically)
  # 5x5=25 grid points (by the first distance rule)
  # AND
  # from 15 to 21 km with a step of 5 km starting from hypocenter location,
  # meaning: 15, 20 km from h. loc. in four directions (east, west,
  # north, south), thus -20, -15, 15, 20 (horizontally and vertically)
  # and 4x4=16 grid points (by the second distance rule)
  # leading to a total of 25+16=41 grid points per depth layer
  # The depth layers will be generated by only one rule. That is:
  # 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30 in two 
  # direction below and above init hypocenter's depth with an automatic 
  # limit of 1 km from the surface. Assuming that we have an event with 50 km 
  # init hyp. depth, will calculate MTs from 50-30=20 km to 50+30=80 km from
  # the surface. Since, we don't reach the limitation of 1 km from surface, it
  # will lead to 15+1+15=31 depth layers leading to the final MT search grid 
  # with a total of 31*41=1271 grid points. The time shifts are configured at
  # a following parameter.
