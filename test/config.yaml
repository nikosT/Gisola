Inventory:
  # Reads inventory from the file. You are responsible to provide updated 
  # XML file for real-time processing (e.g. daily inventory update cron-job).
  # If set to null or file is not found, most updated inventory will be 
  # retrieved from the FDSNWS hosts. However, more time will be consumed 
  # for retrieval
